    %h3 Evaluation
    .row
      .six.columns
        %p Local council planning authorities can require an archaeological evaluation to clarify the extent, nature and the quality of archaeological remains on a proposed development site before granting planning consent, the phrase used would be along the lines of ‘Greater clarity would be provided with the results of an archaeological evaluation, and is requested as per Policy BH 3 of PPS 6.’
        %p Evaluation techniques can include non-intrusive surveys such as field walking, topographical and geophysical survey’s (rarely suitable in Northern Ireland). The most common technique would be mechanical or hand excavation of test trenches, to determine the presence or absence of buried archaeological remains and to determine their significance.
        %p NAC can carry out all necessary evaluation work for your project, using our extensive experience of both urban and rural projects across Northern Ireland, we will negotiate a suitable sampling strategy to give the most effective results within the shortest possible timeframe.

    .row
      .six.columns
        %p After planning consent has been secured, there may be a requirement for archaeological mitigation works to offset the impact of the development. The extent of archaeological mitigating required by a local council authority will vary depending on the character of the archaeological site.

    %h3 Watching brief
    .row
      .six.columns
        %p Watching brief conditions are regularly attached to planning consents, especially where it is though that archaeological remains of unknown importance may exist. An archaeologist will be needed to monitor intrusive groundworks, site stripping or demolition works requiring foundation removal onsite.

    %h3 Archaeological excavation
    .row
      .six.columns
        %p Archaeological excavation involves detailed investigation on sites that are known to be significant. Excavation would follow finding archaeology on a watching brief and would require a Written Scheme of Works agreed with our clients, the local council planners and the Northern Ireland Historic Environment Division. The Written Scheme of Works sets out the aims of the project and the methods of investigation and recording to be used to document the archaeological remains.
        %p The results of the work are then analysed and a detailed report prepared. NAC offers an efficient and professional approach to excavation, making the development process as easy as possible for our clients and ensuring effective targeting of investigations.
        %p Our extensive experience allows us to offer the best solution for all parties and extract the most information possible by ensuring that resources are used in the most effective way.
